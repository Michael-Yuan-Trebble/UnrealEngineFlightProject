# UnrealEngineFlightProject

A custom flight simulation project built in Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints.
The goal of this project is to explore advanced gameplay programming and implementing flight mechanics and physics in the Unreal Engine.
Inspirations of my project come from flight games/simulators such as War Thunder, Ace Combat, and Project Wingman.

## Goals
Some of my goals of the project are:
- Learning UE5 C++ programming and separation of logic
- Learning how to implement aircraft flight physics
- Building HUD and UI systems needed for flight simulators
- Gain experience in designing modular and scalable game systems
- Gain experience in optimization in game making

## Features (WIP)
Some of the Features I have are:
- Custom flight model, most noteably implementation of an AoA (Angle of Attack) system
  - Nose and Forward Vector are different
- Lock on Reticle HUD and system for enemy Aircraft
- Aircraft selection screen

Some of the Features that I am currently actively working on
- Fine tuning the flight performance, especially thrust and speed calculations
- Enemy AI
- Visual Effects such as flares and Afterburner effects
  - These effects are created in Blender and finetuned in Photoshop

All aircraft models are created by me and are made in Blender.

## Tech Stack
- Unreal Engine 5 (C++ and Blueprints)
  - Niagara FX
  - UMG for HUD
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
- Blender
- Photoshop

## Future Plans
Some of my future goals are:
- Expanding and making a "tree" of options for aircraft, for example:
  - The F-15C is the "base" with the options of the F-15E (Strike) and F-15N (Experimental Naval) being available
  - A more polished version of air combat with energy being more in play
  - Advanced weather and extreme weather conditions, affecting AI and user experience
  - Co-op potential
